# Test command — run after agent work and after each merge.

# uses this command to verify each agent's work and each merge.
# The default is a safe no-op — you MUST change it for real sprints.
#
# Examples:
#   Playwright (recommended for dashboard projects):
#     DEFAULT_TEST_CMD="npx playwright test tests/test-unit.spec.js tests/test-integration.spec.js"
#   Python/pytest:
#     DEFAULT_TEST_CMD="python3 -m pytest tests/ -v"
#   Go:
#     DEFAULT_TEST_CMD="go test ./..."
#   Multiple commands:
#     DEFAULT_TEST_CMD="python3 -m pytest tests/ -v && npm run lint"
#
# NOTE: Use python3 (not python) on macOS — there is no 'python' binary.
# NOTE: Avoid 'npm test' — it often wraps the real runner with extra output
#       that can confuse sprint-run.sh exit-code detection.
# NetTrek has no unit-test runner; the correctness gate is a clean
# TypeScript typecheck plus a successful Vite production build. Direct
# binaries (no npm wrapper) so sprint-run.sh exit-code detection is clean.
