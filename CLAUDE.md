# Claude Instructions — nettrek

## Project Overview

NetTrek is a music-reactive vertical-scrolling space shoot-'em-up with a
Star Trek aesthetic. The core pillar: **the music IS the level** — each
song is a stage with its own signature mechanic, fleet composition, and
pacing. Music drives enemy weapons (the "heartbeat"), the procedural
director chooses spawns, and drops surge the action. 11 stages, each ending
in a boss with destroyable named subsystems.

Mobile and Apple Pencil are first-class targets (pen > touch > mouse;
double-tap = phasers, hard-push = shields). The long-term flagship feature
is LLM-backed "agent directors" (see `docs/project-memory/adr/`).

### Tech Stack
- TypeScript + Vite
- Canvas 2D procedural rendering (no engine)
- Web Audio API — FFT analyzer drives the music-reactive gameplay
- PointerEvents for unified mouse / touch / pen input
- Deploy: AWS S3 + CloudFront (dev)
- Optional: Node multiplayer server + DynamoDB beta-signup/leaderboard API

### Key Commands
```bash
npm run dev                  # Vite dev server
npm run build                # tsc typecheck + Vite production build
npx tsc --noEmit             # typecheck only (fast)
bash scripts/deploy-dev.sh   # build + deploy to dev CloudFront
```

### Reference docs
- `docs/game-legend.md`    — every item / enemy / boss / hazard
- `docs/agent-directors.md` — the agent-director vision
- `docs/project-memory/backlog/` — groomed B-NNN / F-NNN tickets

## Afterburner Framework

This project uses the **Afterburner** framework (traceable-searchable-adr-memory-index) for sprint orchestration, project memory, and dashboard tracking.

- **Framework location:** Check `.sprint/.framework-root` for the path
- **Dashboard:** `http://127.0.0.1:1201` — switch to this project in Settings

### Dashboard Data Pipeline

After each sprint merge, rebuild dashboard data:
```bash
# From the framework repo:
PROJECT_ROOT=/Users/chad/GUILD/nettrek OUTPUT_DIR=<framework>/dist/projects/nettrek/data ./scripts/build-sprint-data.sh
```

Or use the dashboard's Settings → "Rebuild Data" button.

**Critical flow:** `sprint-merge.sh` auto-generates `docs/PROJECT_STATUS_*.md` → `build-sprint-data.sh` parses those into JSON → dashboard displays sprints/sessions/ADRs.

## Project Memory System

This repo uses a **Traceable Project Memory** system. Every coding session, commit, and decision must be documented and searchable.

### You MUST Follow These Rules

#### 1. Session ID Format

Every coding session gets a unique Session ID:
```
S-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>
```

**HHMM is UTC** — always use `date -u +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M` to generate the timestamp.

Example: `S-2026-03-10-0616-sprint1-evidence-engine`

#### 2. Commit Message Format

Write a **human-readable subject line**. Put the Session ID in the commit body:
```
Subject line describing the change

Session: S-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug
```

#### 3. Session Documentation

When starting work:

1. **Check if a session exists** for this work:
   ```bash
   ls docs/project-memory/sessions/
   ```

2. **If no session exists, create one:**
   - Copy `docs/project-memory/sessions/_template.md`
   - Name it with the Session ID: `S-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug.md`
   - Fill in Title, Goal, Context, Plan

3. **After making changes, update the session doc:**
   - Add what changed to "Changes Made"
   - Document decisions in "Decisions Made"
   - Link commits after you create them

#### 4. When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR in `docs/project-memory/adr/` when:
- Making significant architectural decisions
- Choosing between technical approaches
- Establishing patterns that will be followed
- Making decisions with long-term consequences

Use the ADR template: `docs/project-memory/adr/_template.md`

#### 5. Backlog (Bugs & Features)

Track work items in `docs/project-memory/backlog/`:
- **Bugs** use a `B-NNN` prefix (e.g., `B-001-login-crash.md`)
- **Features** use an `F-NNN` prefix (e.g., `F-001-dark-mode.md`)
- Each item gets its own markdown file with Summary, Status, Priority
- Update `docs/project-memory/backlog/README.md` table when adding/changing items
- Link backlog items from code comments when relevant (e.g., `# TODO: see F-001`)

#### 6. Searching Project Memory

To find context for code:

**Search commits by Session ID:**
```bash
git log --all --grep="S-2026-03-10-0616-sprint1-evidence-engine"
```

**Search session docs:**
```bash
grep -r "keyword" docs/project-memory/sessions/
```

**Search ADRs:**
```bash
grep -r "decision topic" docs/project-memory/adr/
```

**Search backlog:**
```bash
grep -r "keyword" docs/project-memory/backlog/
```

#### 7. Semantic Search (AI-Powered)

When users ask questions using **concepts** rather than exact keywords:
1. Read ALL session docs and ADRs
2. Match related concepts (synonyms, related terms)
3. Explain WHY results match
4. Cross-reference between sessions, ADRs, and commits

#### 8. Multi-Agent Sprint Orchestration

This repo uses the Afterburner multi-agent sprint system for parallelizing work.

**Fully Automated (recommended):**
```bash
.sprint/scripts/sprint-run.sh                    # init → poll → merge → report → cleanup
.sprint/scripts/sprint-run.sh --push             # also push when done
```

**Manual Workflow:**
1. Write a `SPRINT_BRIEF.md` in the repo root (use template in `docs/project-memory/tools/`)
2. Run `.sprint/scripts/sprint-init.sh` — creates git worktrees and per-agent briefs
3. Run `.sprint/scripts/sprint-tmux.sh` — launches tmux with one tab per agent
4. Agents run autonomously: implement brief, run tests, auto-commit
5. Run `.sprint/scripts/sprint-merge.sh` — merges branches in order, auto-generates `PROJECT_STATUS` doc

**Planning Next Sprint:**
```bash
.sprint/scripts/sprint-plan.sh                   # reads last PROJECT_STATUS + backlog
```

**Configuration:** `.sprint/config.sh` (project-specific settings)

**Agent Rules:**
- Agents run non-interactively — they MUST NOT ask for confirmation
- Each agent works in its own worktree — no shared file modifications
- Agents auto-commit when tests pass
- Check for zero-commit branches after a sprint (indicates stuck agents)

### Your Workflow

1. **Start of work:** Create or identify Session ID (HHMM is UTC)
2. **Create session doc:** Use template, fill in Title/Goal/Context/Plan
3. **Make changes:** Write code
4. **Commit:** Human-readable subject, `Session: S-...` in body
5. **Update session doc:** Add Changes Made, Decisions, Links
6. **Create ADR if needed:** For significant decisions
7. **Create PR:** Reference Session ID, link to session doc

### Quick Reference

- **Session template:** `docs/project-memory/sessions/_template.md`
- **ADR template:** `docs/project-memory/adr/_template.md`
- **Sprint brief spec:** `docs/project-memory/tools/SPRINT_BRIEF_SPEC.md`
- **Sprint brief template:** `docs/project-memory/tools/SPRINT_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Sprint scripts:** `.sprint/scripts/`
- **Agent prompt:** `.sprint/scripts/CLAUDE_RUN_PROMPT.txt`

## Always Enforce

- ✅ Session ID times are UTC (`date -u`)
- ✅ Every commit has `Session: S-...` in the body
- ✅ Every session has a markdown doc with a Title field
- ✅ Significant decisions get ADRs
- ✅ PRs reference Session IDs
- ✅ Session docs link to commits, PRs, ADRs
- ✅ Sprint briefs follow the spec in `docs/project-memory/tools/SPRINT_BRIEF_SPEC.md`
- ✅ `sprint-merge.sh` generates `PROJECT_STATUS` docs — do not create them manually
- ✅ After sprint merge, rebuild dashboard data so sprints appear in the dashboard
